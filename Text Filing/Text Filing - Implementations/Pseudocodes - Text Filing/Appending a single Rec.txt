// PSEUDOCODE FOR ADDING A STUDENT RECORD TO A FILE
// This pseudocode describes the process of collecting a student's information,
// such as roll number, name, contact, fee amount, and fee payment status,
// and then appending this data to an existing file. This is useful for maintaining
// student records in a persistent format.

// Declare variables to store student information
DECLARE rollNo : INTEGER       // To store the roll number of the student
DECLARE sName : STRING         // To store the name of the student
DECLARE sContact : STRING      // To store the contact information of the student
DECLARE sFee : CURRENCY        // To store the fee amount (using a currency data type)
DECLARE isFeePaid : BOOLEAN    // To store whether the fee has been paid or not

// Input student details from the user
INPUT "Enter roll number: ", rollNo
INPUT "Enter student name: ", sName
INPUT "Enter student contact: ", sContact
INPUT "Enter fee amount: ", sFee
INPUT "Is fee paid? (true/false) ", isFeePaid

// Open the file named 'sRec.txt' in append mode to add new data at the end of the file
OPENFILE "sRec.txt" FOR APPEND

// Write the student details to the file 'sRec.txt'
WRITEFILE "sRec.txt", rollNo
WRITEFILE "sRec.txt", sName
WRITEFILE "sRec.txt", sContact
WRITEFILE "sRec.txt", sFee
WRITEFILE "sRec.txt", isFeePaid

// Close the file after writing to it
CLOSEFILE "sRec.txt"
