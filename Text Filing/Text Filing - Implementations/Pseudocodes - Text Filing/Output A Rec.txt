// PSEUDOCODE FOR WRITING/OUTPUTTING RECORDS TO A TEXT FILE
// This pseudocode demonstrates how to write new student records into a file named "ABC.txt".
// It captures details such as General Registration Number (GRNO), student name, class, fee amount, 
// and fee payment status from the user and writes this information into the file.
// The process continues until the user chooses not to add more records.

// Declare variables to store student information and control the input loop
DECLARE GRNO : INTEGER        // To store the General Registration Number of the student
DECLARE sNAME : STRING        // To store the student's name
DECLARE sClass : STRING       // To store the student's class
DECLARE sFee : CURRENCY       // To store the student's fee amount
DECLARE isFeePaid : BOOLEAN   // To store the fee payment status
DECLARE more : CHAR           // To control the continuation of record addition

// Initialize the variables
GRNO = 0                      // Initial GRNO set to 0
sName = ""                    // Initial name set to an empty string
sClass = ""                   // Initial class set to an empty string
sFee = ""                     // Initial fee set to an empty string
isFeePaid = FALSE             // Initial fee payment status set to false
more = ''                     // Initial choice for more records set to empty

// Open the file 'ABC.txt' in write mode
OPENFILE "ABC.txt" FOR WRITE

// Repeat the process of adding records until the user inputs 'N' or 'n'
REPEAT
    // Input the details of the student from the user
    OUTPUT "Enter GRNO: "
    INPUT GRNO

    OUTPUT "Enter student name: "
    INPUT sName

    OUTPUT "Enter class: "
    INPUT sClass

    OUTPUT "Enter fee amount: "
    INPUT sFee

    OUTPUT "Is fee paid: "
    INPUT isFeePaid

    // Write the student details to the file 'ABC.txt'
    WRITEFILE "ABC.txt", GRNO
    WRITEFILE "ABC.txt", sName
    WRITEFILE "ABC.txt", sClass
    WRITEFILE "ABC.txt", sFee
    WRITEFILE "ABC.txt", isFeePaid

    // Ask the user if they want to add more records
    OUTPUT "Do you want to add more records? (Y/N)" 
    INPUT more
UNTIL more = 'N' OR more = 'n' 

// Close the file after writing all records
CLOSEFILE "ABC.txt"
