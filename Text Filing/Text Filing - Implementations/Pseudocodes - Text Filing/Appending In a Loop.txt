// PSEUDOCODE FOR APPENDING STUDENT RECORDS TO A TEXT FILE
// This pseudocode is designed to help students understand how to append new student records to a text file. 
// It involves collecting various details about the student, such as GRNO (General Registration Number), 
// name, class, fee amount, and fee payment status, and then writing these details to a file named "ABC.txt". 
// The process repeats until the user decides not to add more records.

// Declare variables to store student information and control the loop
DECLARE GRNO : INTEGER        // To store the General Registration Number
DECLARE sNAME : STRING        // To store the student's name
DECLARE sClass : STRING       // To store the class of the student
DECLARE sFee : CURRENCY       // To store the fee amount (in a currency format)
DECLARE isFeePaid : BOOLEAN   // To store whether the fee has been paid or not
DECLARE more : BOOLEAN        // Flag to control the loop for adding more records

// Initialize the variables
GRNO = 0                      // Initial GRNO set to 0
sName = ""                    // Initial name set to an empty string
sClass = ""                   // Initial class set to an empty string
sFee = ""                     // Initial fee set to an empty string
isFeePaid = FALSE             // Initial fee payment status set to false
more = TRUE                   // Loop control set to true for initial entry

// Open the file 'ABC.txt' in append mode to add new data at the end of the file
OPENFILE "ABC.txt" FOR APPEND

// Loop to add new records as long as 'more' is true
WHILE more = TRUE
    // Input the student details from the user
    OUTPUT "Enter GRNO: "
    INPUT GRNO

    OUTPUT "Enter student name: "
    INPUT sName

    OUTPUT "Enter class: "
    INPUT sClass

    OUTPUT "Enter fee amount: "
    INPUT sFee

    OUTPUT "Is fee paid: "
    INPUT isFeePaid

    // Write the student details to the file 'ABC.txt'
    WRITEFILE "ABC.txt", GRNO
    WRITEFILE "ABC.txt", sName
    WRITEFILE "ABC.txt", sClass
    WRITEFILE "ABC.txt", sFee
    WRITEFILE "ABC.txt", isFeePaid

    // Ask the user if they want to add more records
    OUTPUT "Do you want to add more records? (TRUE/FALSE): " 
    INPUT more
END WHILE 

// Close the file after all records have been written
CLOSEFILE "ABC.txt"
