// PSEUDOCODE FOR DELETING A RECORD FROM A FILE
// This pseudocode demonstrates the process of deleting a specific record from a file based on roll number.
// It involves reading each record from 'sRec.txt', comparing the roll number with the one to be deleted,
// and writing all other records to a temporary file 'temp.txt'.
// Finally, the original file is replaced with the temporary file.

// Declare variables to store and manipulate student records
DECLARE rollNo : INTEGER       // To store the roll number of a student
DECLARE sName : STRING         // To store the name of a student
DECLARE sContact : STRING      // To store the contact information of a student
DECLARE sFee : CURRENCY        // To store the fee amount
DECLARE isFeePaid : BOOLEAN    // To store the fee payment status
DECLARE isFound : BOOLEAN      // Flag to indicate if the record is found
DECLARE searchRollNo : INTEGER // Roll number to search for deletion

isFound = FALSE // Initialize the 'isFound' flag to FALSE

// Input the roll number to be deleted from the user
INPUT "Enter roll# to delete :", searchRollNo  

// Open the original file for reading and a temporary file for writing
OPENFILE "sRec.txt" FOR READ
OPENFILE "temp.txt" FOR OUTPUT

// Loop through the file to find and skip the record to be deleted
WHILE NOT EOF("sRec.txt") 
  READFILE "sRec.txt", rollNo
  READFILE "sRec.txt", sName
  READFILE "sRec.txt", sContact
  READFILE "sRec.txt", sFee
  READFILE "sRec.txt", isFeePaid

  IF rollNo <> searchRollNo 
    THEN
      // Write all records except the one to be deleted to the temporary file
      WRITEFILE "temp.txt", rollNo
      WRITEFILE "temp.txt", sName
      WRITEFILE "temp.txt", sContact
      WRITEFILE "temp.txt", sFee
      WRITEFILE "temp.txt", isFeePaid
  ELSEIF rollNo = searchRollNo
    THEN
      // Set the flag to TRUE if the record to be deleted is found
      isFound = TRUE
  ENDIF
ENDWHILE

// Close both the original and temporary files
CLOSEFILE "sRec.txt"
CLOSEFILE "temp.txt"

// Delete the original file and rename the temporary file to the original file's name
DELETEFILE "sRec.txt"
RENAMEFILE "temp.txt", "sRec.txt"

// Inform the user if the record was successfully deleted
IF isFound = TRUE THEN OUTPUT "Record deleted..."
