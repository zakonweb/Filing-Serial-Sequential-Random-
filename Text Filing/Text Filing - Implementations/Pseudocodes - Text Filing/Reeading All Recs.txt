// PSEUDOCODE FOR READING/INPUTTING FROM A TEXT FILE
// This pseudocode demonstrates how to read records from a file named "ABC.txt" and display them.
// It uses a while loop along with the EOF() function to read each record until the end of the file.
// Each record consists of General Registration Number (GRNO), student name, class, fee amount, 
// and fee payment status, which are displayed after reading.

// Declare variables to store student information
DECLARE GRNO : INTEGER        // To store the General Registration Number of the student
DECLARE sNAME : STRING        // To store the student's name
DECLARE sClass : STRING       // To store the student's class
DECLARE sFee : CURRENCY       // To store the student's fee amount
DECLARE isFeePaid : BOOLEAN   // To store the fee payment status

// Initialize the variables
GRNO = 0                      // Initial GRNO set to 0
sName = ""                    // Initial name set to an empty string
sClass = ""                   // Initial class set to an empty string
sFee = ""                     // Initial fee set to an empty string
isFeePaid = FALSE             // Initial fee payment status set to false

// Open the file 'ABC.txt' for reading
OPENFILE "ABC.txt" FOR READ

// Loop through the file until the end of the file is reached
WHILE NOT EOF("ABC.txt")
    // Read each piece of data from the file
    READFILE "ABC.txt", GRNO
    READFILE "ABC.txt", sName
    READFILE "ABC.txt", sClass
    READFILE "ABC.txt", sFee
    READFILE "ABC.txt", isFeePaid

    // Output the details of each student record
    OUTPUT "GRNO: ", GRNO
    OUTPUT "Student name: ", sName
    OUTPUT "Class: ", sClass
    OUTPUT "Fee amount: ", sFee
    OUTPUT "Is fee paid: ", isFeePaid
ENDWHILE

// Close the file after all records have been read
CLOSEFILE "ABC.txt"
