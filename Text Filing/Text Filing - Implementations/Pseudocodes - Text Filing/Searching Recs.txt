// PSEUDOCODE FOR READING FROM A TEXT FILE TO SEARCH FOR A SPECIFIC RECORD
// This pseudocode demonstrates reading records from "ABC.txt" and searching for a specific record
// based on a value provided by the user. It displays the details of the record if found.
// If the record is not found, it outputs a message stating that the record could not be found.

// Declare variables to store student information and for the search functionality
DECLARE GRNO : INTEGER        // To store the General Registration Number of the student
DECLARE sNAME : STRING        // To store the student's name
DECLARE sClass : STRING       // To store the student's class
DECLARE sFee : CURRENCY       // To store the student's fee amount
DECLARE isFeePaid : BOOLEAN   // To store the fee payment status
DECLARE Value : INTEGER       // To store the search value
DECLARE isFound : BOOLEAN     // Flag to indicate if the record is found

// Initialize variables
GRNO = 0
sName = ""
sClass = ""
sFee = ""
isFeePaid = FALSE
Value = 0
isFound = FALSE

// Ask the user for the value to search
OUTPUT "Kia search kerna hey bhai?"
INPUT Value 

// Open the file 'ABC.txt' for reading
OPENFILE "ABC.txt" FOR READ

// Loop through the file until the record is found or the end of the file is reached
WHILE NOT EOF("ABC.txt")
    // Read each piece of data from the file
    READFILE "ABC.txt", GRNO
    READFILE "ABC.txt", sName
    READFILE "ABC.txt", sClass
    READFILE "ABC.txt", sFee
    READFILE "ABC.txt", isFeePaid

    // Check if the current record matches the search criteria
    IF GRNO = Value
      THEN
        isFound = TRUE // Set the flag to TRUE if the record is found

        // Output the details of the found record
        OUTPUT "GRNO: ", GRNO
        OUTPUT "Student name: ", sName
        OUTPUT "Class: ", sClass
        OUTPUT "Fee amount: ", sFee
        OUTPUT "Is fee paid: ", isFeePaid
    
        EXIT LOOP

ENDWHILE

// Close the file after searching
CLOSEFILE "ABC.txt"
