// PSEUDOCODE FOR READING ALL RECORDS FROM A FILE
// This pseudocode demonstrates how to read and display all records from a file named "sRec.txt".
// It uses a while loop in combination with the EOF() function to iterate through each record
// until the end of the file is reached. This is a common approach in file handling operations.

// Declare variables to store the information of each student record
DECLARE rollNo : INTEGER       // To store the roll number of a student
DECLARE sName : STRING         // To store the name of a student
DECLARE sContact : STRING      // To store the contact information of a student
DECLARE sFee : CURRENCY        // To store the fee amount
DECLARE isFeePaid : BOOLEAN    // To store whether the fee has been paid or not

// Open the file 'sRec.txt' for reading
OPENFILE "sRec.txt" FOR READ

// Use a while loop to read through the file until the end of the file is reached
WHILE NOT EOF("sRec.txt")
  // Read each piece of data from the file
  READFILE "sRec.txt", rollNo
  READFILE "sRec.txt", sName
  READFILE "sRec.txt", sContact
  READFILE "sRec.txt", sFee
  READFILE "sRec.txt", isFeePaid

  // Output the details of the current record
  OUTPUT "Roll number: ", rollNo
  OUTPUT "Student name: ", sName
  OUTPUT "Student contact: ", sContact
  OUTPUT "Fee amount: ", sFee
  OUTPUT "Is fee paid? ", isFeePaid

ENDWHILE

// Close the file after all records have been read and displayed
CLOSEFILE "sRec.txt"
